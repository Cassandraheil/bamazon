# Bamazon

## What the project does?
* When run, Bamazon displays all of the products in the store with a unique ID and the price. The user is asked to type the id of the product they would like to purchase. Then asked how many of the product they would like. The app checks to make sure there is enough product in stock to fit the order. If there is enough product, the app will total up the cost and display it. If not, the app will alert the customer that there is insufficent quantity.
